- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tomoguy
- 👀 I’m interested in seismic velocity modelling methods and plan to programe a series of tomography programes.
--   Starting from raypath tomography, then some complex traveltime tomography, and waveform based velocity modelling methods.
--   My code will start with one very simple structure, almost without any tricks. 
--   However, it is programmed using simple matlab languages and could provide convenience to implement any ideas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some guys who are also interested in seismic tomography, you could add something based my code if you have any
-    ideas about tomography technology. I will be very happy if you could share your modified version codes to me.
